Listen up, fellow developers. If you aren't using **Astro 5.0** to looksmax your portfolio, you are literally living in **Ohio**. We are out here mewing while our scripts are brewing. No cap, this project is the main character and the CSS is simply **bussin**.

> "One does not simply 'push to main' without first mogging the linter. If your CI/CD isn't edging the deployment for at least 5 minutes, you have negative aura." — _Ancient Sigma Dev Wisdom_

## 🛠 The Tech Stack (Tier List)

We've got the most **aesthetic** stack in the game. If your stack doesn't have this much aura, you're basically a mid-tier NPC glazing the senior devs:

- **Astro:** The literal GOAT. Fast like a Ferrari, zero JS by default.
- **Tailwind v4:** For that instant drip. Utility classes are my love language.
- **Markdown:** Because I'm a purist and I don't need fancy components to tell you your code is mid.
- **TypeScript:** Because raw JS is a massive skill issue and you're delulu if you think otherwise.

### 💀 How to Achieve Maximum Rizz in the Terminal

1.  Open your terminal (make sure it's customized or you're a beta).
2.  Type `npm run dev` and feel the electricity of a thousand Skibidi toilets.
3.  Check the logs. If you see an error, don't cry, just **delulu** your way into a fix.
4.  Ship it to Vercel and let the **Fanum Tax** begin.

## 💻 Code or it Didn't Happen

Here is a snippet of some **unhinged** logic I wrote while I was locked in the basement drinking Prime:

```typescript
function checkAura(devName: string): string {
  const isSigma = true;
  const hasRizz = Math.random() > 0.1;

  if (devName === "shasherazi" && isSigma) {
    return "Infinite Rizz Detected ⚡️";
  } else if (!hasRizz) {
    return "Ratio + L + No Dependencies + You're Mid";
  }
  return "Locked in.";
}

// Log it or you're an NPC
console.log(checkAura("shasherazi"));
```

### 📈 Aura Tier List (No Glazing)

| Feature         | My Aura            | Hater Aura              |
| :-------------- | :----------------- | :---------------------- |
| **Build Speed** | 0.2s (Light Speed) | 4-5 business days       |
| **Styling**     | Tailwind v4 (Drip) | Inline styles (Cringe)  |
| **Framework**   | Astro (Goated)     | jQuery (Locked in 2012) |
| **Vibe**        | Pure Rizz          | Negative Aura           |

## 🖼 The Visual Drip

If you aren't adding images to your blogs, you are literally yapping into the void. This image represents my mental state during a merge conflict:

### 🧐 Final Thoughts (The Deep Yap)

At the end of the day, if your code doesn't make the senior devs **low-key terrified**, are you even even a real engineer? Keep grinding, keep mewing, and never let anyone tell you your `node_modules` are too heavy. They just don't understand the **grindset**.

1. Stay **locked in**.
2. Stay **skibidi**.
3. Avoid **Ohio** deployment zones.
4. Don't let them **ratio** your pull request.
